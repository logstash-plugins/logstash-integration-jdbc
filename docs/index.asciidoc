=== Jdbc_static filter plugin

include::{include_path}/plugin_header.asciidoc[]

==== Description

This filter is best suited for event enhancement from static or
reference data that does not change very often. Examples of these
are environments, users and products. Locally there is a database
that the enhancement lookups are done against. Remotely there is
a database that has the static data. The local db is loaded with
data from the remote db once or very periodically. To achieve this
three main sections are defined: db_objects, loaders and lookups.
The local database is an
https://db.apache.org/derby/manuals/#docs_10.14[Apache Derby]
in-memory database.

Db_objects

Define as many of theses as needed to build the local database
structure. Define tables, columns and indexes.

Loaders

Define as many loaders as needed to fetch the remote data. Each
loader should fill a table created via a db_object. Make sure
the column names/datatypes in the loader SQL statement match the
columns defined in its corresponding db_object. Each loader has
an independent remote database connection.

Lookups

Define as many lookups as needed to enhance the event from all
lookup tables in one pass. Ideally the SQL statement should only
return one row. Any rows are converted to Hash objects and are
stored in a target field that is an Array.

Example config:

[source,ruby]

  jdbc_static {
    loaders => [
      {
        id => "remote-servers"
        query => "select ip, descr from ref.local_ips order by ip"
        local_table => "servers"
      },
      {
        id => "remote-users"
        query => "select firstname, lastname, userid from ref.local_users order by userid"
        local_table => "users"
      }
    ]
    local_db_objects => [

==== Using this plugin in multiple pipelines in a Logstash instance
[IMPORTANT]
===============================
As the lookup database engine, an in-memory Apache Derby instance,
is a single instance for the whole JVM, each plugin instance whether
per pipeline or as multiple plugins in one pipeline will use a
unique database inside the shared Derby engine so there should be
no conflicts with plugins creating tables and populating them even
if the same settings are used. However you should watch the lookup
results and the logs initially to verify correct operation.

|=======================================================================

Loader Field Descriptions::
id:::
An optional identifier. This is used to identify the loader that is
generating error messages and log lines.
table:::
This is the destination table in local lookup db that the loader will fill.
query:::
The SQL statement that is executed to fetch the remove records. Use SQL
aliases and casts to ensure that the records columns and datatype match the
table structure in the local db as defined in the `local_db_objects`
max_rows:::
The default for this setting is 1 million. As the lookup db is in-memory,
it will take up JVM heap space. If the query would return many millions
of rows you should increase the JVM memory given to Logstash OR limit the
number of rows returned, perhaps to those most frequently found in the
event data.
jdbc_connection_string:::
If not set in a loader, this setting defaults to the plugin level
`jdbc_connection_string` setting.
jdbc_driver_class:::
If not set in a loader, this setting defaults to the plugin level
`jdbc_driver_class` setting.
jdbc_driver_library:::
If not set in a loader, this setting defaults to the plugin level
`jdbc_driver_library` setting.
jdbc_password:::
If not set in a loader, this setting defaults to the plugin level
`jdbc_password` setting.
jdbc_user:::
If not set in a loader, this setting defaults to the plugin level
`jdbc_user` setting.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-local_db_objects"]
===== `local_db_objects`

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * Default value is `[]`

The array should contain one or more Hashes. Each Hash represents a table
schema for the local lookups database. Each Hash is validated
according to the table below.

[cols="<,<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Setting |Input type|Required
| name|string|Yes
| columns|array|Yes
| index_columns|number|No
| preserve_existing|boolean|No
|=======================================================================

Local_db_objects Field Descriptions::
name:::
The name of the table to be created in the database.
columns:::
An array of column specifications. Each column specification is an array
of exactly two elements, for example `["ip", "varchar(15)"]`. The first
element is the column name string. The second element is a string that
should be an
https://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.14/ref/crefsqlj31068.html[Apache Derby SQL type].
The string content is not checked during settings validation but when the
local lookup tables are built any misspelled SQL type strings will give errors.
index_columns:::
An array of strings. Each string must have been defined in the `columns`
setting. The index name will be generated internally. Unique or sorted indexes
are not supported.
preserve_existing:::
This setting, when `true`, will check whether the table exists in the local
lookup database already. If you have multiple pipelines running in the same
instance of Logstash and more than one pipeline is using this plugin then you
must read the important multiple pipeline notice at the top of the page.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-local_lookups"]
===== `local_lookups`

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * Default value is `[]`

The array should contain one or more Hashes. Each Hash represents a lookup
enhancement. Each Hash is validated according to the table below.

[cols="<,<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Setting |Input type|Required
| id|string|No
| query|string|Yes
| parameters|hash|Yes
| target|string|No
| default_hash|hash|No
| tag_on_failure|string|No
| tag_on_default_use|string|No
|=======================================================================

Local_lookups Field Descriptions::
id:::
An optional identifier. This is used to identify the lookup that is
generating error messages and log lines. If you omit this setting then a
default id is used instead.
query:::
A SQL SELECT statement that is executed to achieve the lookup. To use
parameters, use named parameter syntax, for example
"SELECT * FROM MYTABLE WHERE ID = :id"
parameters:::
A key/value Hash or dictionary. The key (LHS) is the text that is
substituted for in the SQL statement
`SELECT * FROM sensors WHERE reference = :p1`. The value (RHS)
is the field name in your event. The plugin reads the value from
this key out of the event and substitutes that value into the
statement, e.g. `parameters => { "p1" => "ref" }`. Quoting is
automatic - you do not need to put quotes in the statement.
Only use the field interpolation syntax on the RHS if you need to
add a prefix/suffix or join two event field values together to build
the substitution value. For example, imagine an IOT message that has
an id and a location and you have a table of sensors that have a
column of `id-loc_id`, in this case your parameter hash would look
like this: `parameters => { "p1" => "%{[id]}-%{[loc_id]}" }`
target:::
An optional name for the field that will receive the looked up data.
If you omit this setting then the `id` setting (or the default id) is
used. The looked up data, an array of results converted to Hashes, is
never added to the root of the event. If you want to do this then you
should use the `add_field` setting to achieve this. This means that
you are in full control of how the fields/values are put in the root
of the event, e.g.
`add_field => { user_firstname => "%{[user][0][firstname]}" }` -
where `[user]` is the target field `[0]` is the first result in the
array and `[firstname]` is the key in the result hash.
default_hash:::
An optional hash that will be put in the target field array when the
lookup returns no results. Use this if you need to ensure that later
references in other parts of the config actually refer to something.
tag_on_failure:::
An optional string that overrides the plugin level setting. This is
useful when defining multiple lookups.
tag_on_default_use:::
An optional string that overrides the plugin level setting. This is
useful when defining multiple lookups.
